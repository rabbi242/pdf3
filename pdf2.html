<h1>Ceasefire CCTV Systems</h1>

<h2>Call us Idealistic, But we Predict a Crime-Free Future.</h2>

<p>Is it possible to rid a country of crime?</p>
<p>
On the face of it, it seems a daunting task. But it can be done. Thanks is no small part to innovations in technology.The very<br /> technology that has helped create Ceasefire’s futuristic CCTV  System.</p>

<p>With this system, you can keep a close eye on your home or workplace round the clock. Which means no matter what<br /> happens or where you may be when it happens, you'll be the first to know.</p>

<h1>What is a CCTV System?</h1>

   <p>A CCTV System comprises of a DVR (Digital Video Recorder) and one or more<br />cameras.</p>
   <p>
This cutting edge system acts like an intelligence unit that reports only to you<br />helping you monitor your home or workplace throughout the day. The cameras<br />pick up any action in their field of vision, display it on a monitor and feed it into<br />
the DVR, which records and stores it for future references.
  </p>
  <p>
With a vast range of cameras, DVRs and accessories the CCTV surveillance<br />system can be  customised to suit your needs.
  </p>

<h1>Features</h1>

  <ul>
  <li>
It has an independent power supply unit to ensure consistent Power supply to all the devices in case of an electrical.<br /> Or UPS failure.</li>
   <li>Offers a variety of sophisticated cameras with several features.</li>
   <li>One DVR can be connected to several cameras.</li>
   <li>Can be customised to suit different types of environments.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Homes</h3>

<p>
Thanks to the Ceasefire CCTV System, you will never have to worry about<br />leaving domestic help alone at home again. Our Dome Cameras provide a 360<br />degree view, allowing you to keep an eye on every corner of your home. You<br />can find out if your expensive necklace was misplaced or stolen by accessing<br />footage recorded by the DVR. With this system, you can leave your home<br />confident that no one will be able to enter it without your knowledge.</p>

<h3>Offices</h3>

<p>
With our CCTV cameras you will never have to worry about what goes on in your<br />workplace after office hours. If there are sensitive areas that need to be<br />monitored constantly; our system, equipped with motion detectors, will know<br />what to look out for. The cameras are cost effective and can be programmed to<br />begin recording the second the area under surveillance is trespassed or<br />disturbed in any way.</p>

<img src="img/3.jpg" alt="some text" />

<h3>Factories</h3>

<p>
With our state-of-the-art surveillance system, factory owners can oversee<br />thousands of people at the same time and ensure that everything runs smoothly.<br />Our cameras are sophisticated enough to function perfectly even in less-thanideal<br />situations. Our Wide Dynamic Range Cameras, for instance, can<br />automatically adjust their sensors to suit the lighting of the area under<br />surveillance providing you with clear images even if there is a huge contrast in<br />lighting, allowing you to keep a vigilant eye on every corner of your factory.</p>

<img src="img/4.jpg" alt="some text" />

<h3>Retail Outlets</h3>

<p>
CCTV systems are indispensable in retail outlets where one has to monitor a<br />
vast area and hundreds of people at once.</p>
<p>
The Ceasefire CCTV System makes it possible to identify shoplifters in large<br />crowds. Our DVRs allow you to view footage of several cameras at once, and<br />
zoom in to the action if necessary.</p>
<p>
The system’s motion detectors react to any disturbance in the area under<br />
surveillance; and the Day and Night cameras provide clear images even at night.</p>

<h3>Ceasefire CCTV Cameras</h3>

<p>
Ceasefire’s state-of-the-art CCTV cameras have Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) sensors that offer crystal clear images and can<br />be mounted on walls or ceilings. The range of cameras is broadly divided into Bullet Cameras and Dome Cameras.</p>

<h3>Bullet Cameras</h3>

<p>
Integrated cameras and lenses that are sealed to prevent moisture from seeping<br />in are referred to as Bullet Cameras. Most of these cameras have a large<br />viewing angle. They are also compact, which makes them perfect for domestic<br />and commercial properties.</p>

<img src="img/6.jpg" alt="some text" />

<h3>Dome Cameras</h3>

<p>
The camera’s dome-like shape is what gives it its name. The Dome Camera’s<br />unique design makes it difficult to judge where the camera is pointing without<br />close inspection. These cameras can be wall-mounted or ceiling-mounted.</p>

<img src="img/7.jpg" alt="some text" />

<h3>Camera Features</h3>

<p>
The DNR DSP chipset has various powerful functions that give superior high resolution Day and Night images. It removes camera noise and the Sensor provides quality images at very low luminance levels. The most advanced technology is combined on a single DSP chipset, resulting in enhanced surveillance images.</p>

<p>WDR (Wide Dynamic Range)</p>

<p>
WDR is a powerful and ultra-advanced technology<br />that captures cleaner and superior high resolution<br />pictures even where images appear dark because<br />of the presence of strong back light.</p>

<img src="img/log5.jpg" alt="some text"/>
<p>Anti-Cobweb Function</p>
<p>
This function emits a special high frequency signal
that detracts spiders and other insects. This
function is adjustable with the use of a remote
control.</p>

<img src="img/24.jpg" alt="some text"/><br />

<img src="img/log17jpg.jpg" alt="some text"/>
<p>Adjustment by remote control</p>
<p>
Similar to the zoom in/out function of the zoom camera, the
auto focus lens was developed to use the easy focus
adjustment with the wireless remote control. Along with focus
the OSD control can also be adjusted with one remote
control.</p>

<img src="img/25.jpg" alt="some text"/><br />

<img src="img/log18.jpg" alt="some text"/>
<p>Exterior Focus Adjustment</p>
<p>
The camera’s focus can be controlled by using the
exterior focus control ring without opening the
camera’s casing. It is completely water resistant
with an IP66 Certification.</p>


<img src="img/26.jpg" alt="some text"/><br />

<img src="img/log19.jpg" alt="some text"/>
<p>Extra Video Tester Port</p>
<p>
There is an extra video test port to adjust to the
best performance during installation. The
brightness level of these IR lights can be easily
controlled by using the IR control volume button for
the user's umpteen number of environments.</p>

<img src="img/27.jpg" alt="some text"/><br />

<img src="img/log20.jpg" alt="some text"/>
<p>PIR Sensor Camera</p>
<p>
The built in PIR sensor activates the white LED
when an intruder forcibly enters as a warning
signal. The colour picture can be used to verify the
face and features of the subject.</p>

<img src="img/28.jpg" alt="some text"/> <br />

<img src="img/log23.jpg" alt="some text"/>
<p>180° Panoramic Camera without Blind Spot</p>
<p>

angle. With this panoramic view, the blind spot is
completely negligible.</p>

<img src="img/29.jpg" alt="some text"/> <br />

<img src="img/log24.jpg" alt="some text"/>
<p>Easy Installation Bracket</p>
<p>
The multi axis bracket was initially designed similar to a gear
system for easy installation of the camera. The camera can be
easily installed in any place or position.</p>

<h3>What is a DVR</h3>
<p>
DVRs are at the heart of the Ceasefire CCTV System. These recorders receive images from the CCTV camera, digitize them and store them electronically. The most common media for storage are hard disk drives like those used in personal computers.
</p>
<p>
Ceasefire's DVRs are available in three variants: 4 Channel, 8 Channel and 16 Channel. Ceasefire 4 Channel DVR is suitable for smaller shops / factories / office environment. It can hold up to 4 cameras and perform the basic functions of recording high resolution images.
</p>
<p>
The 8 and 16 Channel variants are part of the HD Range. These DVRs can store High-Definition images from up to 16 CCTVs.
They are best suited for larger or more sensitive organizations such as dark warehouses, jewellery or white goods stores and high-security government areas.
